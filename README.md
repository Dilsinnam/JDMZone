<!-- LEGEND -->
## Legend

<b>Needs Rating/Review</b> - Is well known across the community but has little to no actual reviews<br><br>
<b>N/A</b> - Site/Company houses more than just Automotive, cannot be rated<br><br>
<b>(?)</b> - Some site has reviews but is not known by me or members of the community, needs reassurance<br><br>
<b>Not many ratings found, confirmed legit and safe through local communities and forums</b> - The Site/Company does not have many reviews online but is well known throughout communites and car forums, and are confirmed safe, OR the company houses many parts and have reviews on the parts, not an overall review.<br><br>
<b>Ratings depend on store location</b> - A major chain of stores across countrie(s) that cannot be rated as each store has their own rating<br><br>
